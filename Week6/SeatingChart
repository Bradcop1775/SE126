#Write a program that can be used by a small theater to sell tickets for performances.  The theaterâ€™s auditorium has 15 rows of seats with 30 seats in each row. The program should display a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken.  Seats thar are available are represented by # and seats that are taken are represent by a *.  There are aisles after seats H and V.

# Variable List
# seating_chart = 2D list representing the seating chart
# prices = list representing ticket prices for each row 
# total_sales = total amount of money accumulated from all ticket sales
# current_sales = list of prices for seats purchased in the current transaction
# sold_seats = list of tuples representing the seats that have been sold 
# seat_index = index of the selected seat in the seating chart, based on the user's input
# row = row number selected by the user for purchasing a seat 
# seat = seat letter/number selected by the user for purchasing a seat 
# price = cost of the selected seat based on its row
# total_cost = total cost of all seats purchased in the current transaction
# amount_paid = amount of money provided by the user during checkout
# change = amount of money returned to the user after payment
# choice = user's menu selection 
# row_display = formatted string representing a row in the seating chart, used for displaying the chart in a properly aligned manner
